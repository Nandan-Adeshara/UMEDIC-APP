# UMEDIC-APP
An online platform to store and retrieve medical history

# To start using  the app, create following 3 folders in the code directory-
doctors_file_uploads
doctors_img_uploads
patients_img_uploads

# I have used XAMPP to run the code locally.
# store the downloaded folder with the code in 'htddocs' folder of XAMPP
# Open XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL and then,
# In SQL admin, create a database called medical_history

Now you are ready to run the app in your browser( I used chrome as it provides better support for newer HTML and CSS versions(More functionalities).
